LONG_FEEDBACK = "The captivating world of marine life has long held" \
                " the fascination of both scientists and the general public alike." \
                " Delving into the depths of the ocean reveals a complex ecosystem teeming with" \
                " a variety of creatures, each uniquely adapted to life beneath the waves." \
                " Among these marine denizens, coral reefs stand out due to their vibrant" \
                " beauty and the critical role they play in the marine environment." \
                " These underwater structures are not just biologically diverse but are" \
                " also crucial for the survival of numerous species of fish and marine" \
                " organisms that depend on them for shelter, food, and breeding grounds." \
                " Coral reefs are often referred to as the" \
                " because of their rich biodiversity. They are formed by colon" \
                "ies of coral polyps held together by calcium carbonate and are home to thousands of " \
                "different species of fish, invertebrates, and plants. Aside from their biological importance," \
                " coral reefs provide significant economic value to human communities around the world." \
                " Many industries such as fishing and tourism depend heavily on the health of coral reefs." \
                " They also offer coastal protection by reducing the power of waves hitting the coast," \
                " thus preventing erosion. However, these crucial ecosystems are facing unprecedented" \
                " threats due to climate change, ocean acidification, overfishing, and pollution." \
                " Rising sea temperatures cause coral bleaching, a stress response in which corals" \
                " expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues, losing their color and vital" \
                " sources of energy. This not only affects the corals but also the myriad species that rely on" \
                " them for survival. The conservation of coral reefs is thus of paramount importance," \
                " demanding immediate and concerted efforts globally to mitigate human impacts and ensure" \
                " that these underwater rainforests continue to thrive and support the vast array of life" \
                " forms they harbor."
